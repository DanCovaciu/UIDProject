        <h1>North America</h1>
        <h3>Solar photovoltaic capacity</h3>
        <p>65 313 MegaWatts</p>
        <p>Solar Energy Market in North America is mainly dominated by the US. Canada, Mexico and the US have set
            various regulatory frameworks and policies to develop their renewable energy from various sources such as
            solar and wind power. Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) and Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) systems are also adopted
            the US, Canada and Mexico to endorse the renewable energies.</p>
        <p>Canada and Mexico also set some goals for solar energy as both countries have the potential to generate a
            substantial amount of solar energy. Both countries are working to encourage the use of solar energy in
            residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The solar market is getting traction as the Canadian
            government planned to achieve the target of 6,300 MW of solar electricity by 2020, although it would account
            for just 1% of total electricity generated in Canada.</p>

        <h1>South America</h1>
        <p>The solar energy market in Central and South America has considerable growth potential. The region is an
            ideal place for solar power generation due to energy need in remote areas. The solar power generation is
            anticipated to peak in the coming years.
        </p>
        <p>Brazil, Uruguay and Chile are heavily investing in the solar energy market. The region is also working to
            improve its climate records by investing in renewable energy projects and adopting new energy policies to
            mitigate climate change impacts. In response to climate change, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay,
            Uruguay, Peru, and Venezuela are trying to change their energy mix and prioritise renewable energy
            sources.</p>

        <h3>Solar photovoltaic capacity</h3>
        <p>115 234 MegaWatts</p>
        <h3>Concentrated Solar Power</h3>
        <p>Solar power, the production of electricity from solar energy, is performed either directly, through
            photovoltaics, or indirectly, using concentrated solar power (CSP). One advantage that CSP has is the
            ability to add thermal storage and provide power up to 24 hours a day. Gemasolar, in Spain, was the
            first to provide 24-hour power.</p>

        <h1>Africa</h1>
        <p>
            The whole continent has a long duration of sunshine, and excluding the large areas of tropical rainforests
            (the Guinean Forests of West Africa and much of the Congo Basin), since desert and savannah regions of
            Africa stand up as Earth's largest cloud-free area. Africa is dominated by clear skies even beyond
            deserts (ex : Sahara, Namib, Kalahari), however, the regions located along the equator are considerably
            cloudier than the tropics and subtropics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The eastern Sahara/northeastern Africa is particularly noted for its world sunshine records. The area
            experiences some of the greatest mean annual duration of bright sunshine, as the sun shines bright during
            approximatively as much as 4,300 hours a year, which is equal to 97% of the possible total. This
            region also has the highest mean annual values of solar radiation (the maximum recorded being over 220
            kcal/cm2).

        <h1>Asia</h1>
        <p>In many regions of India and Southeast Asia the sun shines often and intensively. However, this source of
            energy is still used to varying degrees in different regions. While larger projects are already underway in
            India, the potential in Southeast Asia is still largely untapped. In the future, however, solar energy could
            be used to provide the additional energy capacity that will be needed in the growth regions - by 2035 this
            would be 580 GW in India and 250 GW in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <h1>Oceania</h1>
        <p>A number of Pacific island states have committed to high percentages of renewable energy use, both to serve
            as an example to other countries and to cut the high costs of imported fuels. A number of solar
            installations have been financed and assisted by Japan, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Solar
            farms have gone online in Tuvalu, Fiji and Kiribati. UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund solar projects
            completed by Masdar in 2016 included: 1MW in the Solomon Islands, 500 kW in Nauru, 600 kW in the Marshall
            Islands, 600 kW in Micronesia and a 450 kW solar-diesel hybrid plant in Palau. American Samoa has
            2 MW of solar installed at Pago Pago Airport.</p>
        <h3>Australia</h3>
        <p>Australia had over 13,904 megawatts (MW) of installed photovoltaic (PV) solar power by September 2019.</p>
        <h3>New Zealand</h3>
        <p>Solar power in New Zealand is on the rise, but operates in an entirely free market with no form of subsidies
            or intervention from the New Zealand Government. As of January 2019, New Zealand has 90.1 MW of installed
            photovoltaic (PV) solar power, of which 19 MW were installed in the preceding 12 months.</p>
        <p> Although there are no subsidies, the declining costs of photovoltaics has caused a large increase in demand
            over the last few years. In 2009, the average turnkey price for a standard PV system of three kilowatts (kW)
            was about NZ$40,000, and has since dropped significantly to NZ$9,000.</p>
